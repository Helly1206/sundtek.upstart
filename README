Sundtek upstart script

This script syncronizes the upstart order of sundtek and tvheadend to prevent sundtek not being found by tvheadend
And run a watchdog to check if sundtek is running correctly

To install, simply type:
sudo install.sh

Settings can be changed in /etc/sundtek.conf

CAUTION: This script is not tested completely. Works in my case, but may give issues.
